    <h3><b>Our Values</b></h3>
    <p>Asia Highlights' vision is creating beautiful journeys, for our discerning customers as well as for us.It was in 1998 that Victor Shu started China Highlights as a way to help Westerner individuals discover the real China. As a tour guide for 4 years, he had been fed up with guiding foreign travelers in large groups, merely scratching the surface of China on inflexible tourist trap tours. He initiated a new way of travel in China: private tours, created to match your own interests and budget</p>
