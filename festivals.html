        <p>Holi is a Hindu festival that takes place in March every year and is the celebration of the victory of good over evil. Holi is often called the Festival of Colors due to the countrywide chaotic colored-power fight that takes place on this day of boisterous celebrations.</p>
        <p>The legend behind Holi begins with the demon Holika who was defeated by the hero Prahlada under the guidance of Lord Vishnu. To celebrate the destruction of the demon, on the night of the full moon in March a statue of Holika is symbolically burned and the death of the demon is celebrated the following day with color fights, laughing, dancing, singing, and parades.</p>
        <p>This is one of the favorite Indian festivals among travelers who are often drawn to Holi by the contagious joy of the participants and the chance to capture incredible photographs.</p>

        <p>Raksha Bandhan, also called Rakhi, is a traditional festival that celebrates the bond between siblings. Raksha Bandhan means 'to tie a knot of protection' in Sanskrit and comes from the festival's main ceremony in which a sister ties a bracelet on the wrist of her brother for his safety and prosperity.</p>
        <p>The bracelets used during the festival are called rakhis and are made from colorful woven threads and decorated with beads and stones.</p>
        <p>Once a sister has tied the rakhi around the wrist of the brother, he will give her sweets and gifts. The sister will also offer prayers for her brother and place a red mark or tilak on his forehead.Today, Raksha Bandhan is not only practiced between brothers and sisters but also between friends, cousins, and anyone else who has a sibling-like relationship.</p>
